                    <p>The main dishes associated with Morocco are tagine and couscous. 
                       You’ll never see these served together, they are separate dishes—and 
                       couscous from a package is sacrilege! Couscous is traditionally eaten 
                       on a Friday (the holy day) and is the Moroccan equivalent of Sunday lunch. 
                       It’s painstakingly hand rolled from semolina and steamed with the meat 
                       and vegetables. In Marrakesh, you’ll also find tangia, a stew cooked in
                       a clay pot in the embers underneath the hammam  (as opposed to on a stove 
                       top in an earthenware tagine).
